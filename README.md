A hands-on repository to learn and experiment with GitHub Actions for automation, CI/CD, and workflow management.


# ðŸ”§ GitHub Actions Workflow Basics

A workflow YAML file defines:

- **When to run** (`on`)
- **What machine to run on** (`runs-on`)
- **What steps to take** (`steps`, using either `run:` or `uses:`)

## ðŸ§© GitHub Actions Workflow Structure Overview

### ðŸ”¹ `jobs`

A **job** is a collection of steps that run in the same environment (e.g., one runner).  
Each job runs in a separate VM/container by default.  
Jobs can run in **parallel** or **sequentially** (if configured with `needs:`).

### ðŸ”¹ `steps`

A **step** is a single task inside a job â€” like checking out code, running a script, installing dependencies, etc.  
All steps in a job run on the **same runner**, so they can **share state** (e.g., files, environment variables).

## ðŸ’¡ Example: Multiple Jobs

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Build
        run: echo "Building app..."

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build  # Waits for the 'build' job to finish
    steps:
      - name: Run tests
        run: echo "Running tests..."

---

## ðŸ’¡ Example: Multiple Steps in One Job

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build
        run: ./mvnw clean install

      - name: Test
        run: ./mvnw test
